This is a realization of WaveNet paper (https://arxiv.org/abs/1609.03499)

To run this code:

1. install all packages with 'requirements.txt'

2. run script in 'workshop.ipynb' to get LJSpeech Dataset (https://keithito.com/LJ-Speech-Dataset)
    (change path to dataset if necessary in train_config in 'configs.py' file)

3. run 'run.py'

4. paste model weights path in 'PATH' variable in 'generate.ipynb' to listen generated samples

P.S.
    Usually such a model needs 3-4 days of appropriate training to get adequate results
